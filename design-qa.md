## Result

final result: passed

## Notes

- The About content now uses the Auxero/Day Night Auto page shell with a single page banner instead of a second hero-style intro.
- The first About section is a compact overview card, proof cards, and a wide image band with real Day Night Auto import, VIN, document, cost, viewing, selling, and handoff content.
- Service, stats, reviews, and process sections use calm cards and restrained borders.
- The team section uses the original Auxero `sale-agent-box` cards again, including the social reveal behavior.
- Remaining variance from the ImageGen reference is intentional: implementation keeps existing Auxero header, banner, footer, typography, and reusable cards.

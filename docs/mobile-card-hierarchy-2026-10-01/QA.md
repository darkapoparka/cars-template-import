# Import mobile card hierarchy — 1 October 2026

Canonical source: `L:/CODEX/cars/templates/import`, Cars `main`. This is reusable template polish. Dealer configuration, inventory data, desktop card composition, release pins and dealer deployments were preserved.

## Changes

- Homepage: larger photo, two-line title, title/price before quieter 24px specification chips, and an outlined details action with a 44px touch target.
- Inventory: approximately 42/58 photo/body split, compact mileage over the photo, year/fuel chips and a plain transmission line. Larger text stacks the photo above the body.
- Import recommendations: year and mileage are the visible specification priorities.
- Card-only labels shorten petrol/LPG combinations to `LPG`, English `Automatic` to `Auto`, and mileage to thousands, for example `125,9k км`. Complete values remain available to assistive technology and in title attributes; source values remain unchanged.
- Menu: existing configured logo above the location and phone in a contained banner. The language control follows the links in the scrolling content. The Sell destination remains available as a menu link.
- Bottom navigation: quiet inactive controls, red active icon/indicator and room for enlarged, wrapped captions.

## Verification

Node `24.21.0`, retained npm lockfile. A complete temporary source copy had its own `npm ci` and build output; the active dev output was preserved. Its 1,772 source/asset/configuration files matched the canonical source byte for byte before the documentation receipt was added. SHA-256 manifest digest: `2a6bcd74777ab9233f13b4f0207823d1de2d75307656ed627274db482c061ca1`. Dependencies, generated output, local runtime artifacts, Git and environment files were excluded; retained legacy `.template-ref` sources were included.

- `npm run check`: zero errors and warnings.
- Prettier and ESLint for the ten changed source/test files: passed. `git diff --check`: passed.
- `npm run check:architecture`: passed, 57 native routes and 195 reachable modules.
- `npm run check:assets`: passed, 855 image signatures.
- `npm run test:unit -- --run`: 124 tests passed across 18 files.
- `npm run build`: passed with the Vercel adapter. Existing non-fatal legacy `@reference` warnings remain.
- Chromium card geometry: 16 checks passed across BG/EN homepage, inventory and import at 320/390px, plus 200% text at 320px. Photos loaded, titles exceeded badge text size, and cards/navigation had no horizontal overflow or clipped labels. No page errors.

- Frozen production preview: `tests/commerce-banners.e2e.ts`, `tests/inventory.e2e.ts` and `tests/mobile-navigation.e2e.ts`, desktop/mobile with one worker: 17 passed, 11 viewport-specific skips, zero failures. Coverage includes eight menu banner size/language combinations, the scrolling locale control, homepage actions, Contact/Sell/Import navigation, focus/back dismissal, SSR inventory, filters and detail return.
- Targeted `tests/mobile-final.e2e.ts` automated accessibility/reflow scans of `/en`, `/en/inventory` and `/en/import` at 320px: three passed, zero detected WCAG-tagged violations. The four EN/BG menu scans also passed.

Final captures: [homepage](home-320.png), [inventory](inventory-320.png), [import](import-320.png), [menu](menu-320.png) and [200% inventory/navigation](inventory-320-large-text.png). [Card geometry](card-geometry.json) and [source manifest](source-manifest.json) preserve the measurements and digest. The temporary production QA server is stopped; the canonical dev preview remains on port 6790.

## Limits and preservation

The repository-wide `npm run verify` gate is blocked by existing formatting differences in `docs/mobile-service-cards-2026-09-30/metrics.json` and six ignored recovery scripts under `runtime/banner-nav-20260930`. Repository-wide ESLint also rejects three existing `runtime/mobile-polish/source-after-*.svelte` recovery files outside its TypeScript project. Those files were preserved; scoped checks passed.

Earlier mutable-dev navigation checks encountered a Rolldown out-of-memory error on cold routes. The final production run uses independent, immutable build output. Historical screenshot files briefly written by old test paths were restored to their original bytes; the tests now write captures to their own Playwright output directory.

This local pass does not verify mounted `/variant-2`, physical devices, a public alias, real form delivery, an immutable template release or dealer rollout. Owner visual acceptance remains separate.

Automatic approval review rejected removal of the task-owned temporary QA copy with `blocked by policy`, including a second attempt using its verified literal path. No more specific reason was returned. The preserved directory is `L:/CODEX/cars/runtime/import-mobile-hierarchy-20261001/source`; it is verification output with no branch or worktree. Its port 6791 server was stopped. The next cleanup action is to verify that exact directory again and remove only that copy when permitted; the master and saved evidence must remain.
